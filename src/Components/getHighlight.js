            An untrained person seated in the cockpit of a modern get liner would
            be completely bewildered by the array of gauges and controls before
            him - but he would not be surprised or bothered by this because he
            recognizes that flying an airplane is a complicated task that he is
            unable to perform.   However, when he struggles to operate a door,
            switches, water faucets, and other common everyday devices,
            he becomes quite upset.
